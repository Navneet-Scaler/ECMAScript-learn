    //1. What is Templatre Literals?
    //3. Use function and some operations with it.
    

    // Problem - The issue was to concatenate Variables with string issues were coming so to overcome same we did this.
    // Also called as String Template Literals - 
    
    let quote="Either you run the code or code runs you.";
    let by = "Navneet";
    let user = "Peter";
    let x = 10;
    let y = 20;
    function fullName() {
        return "Navneet Kolhi"
    }

    // Old way
    console.log("Either you run the code or code runs you." + " You " + by + user);

    // Template literals - using BackTicks 
    // console.log(`Either you run the code or code runs you
    // Navneet`
    // );
    
    // We can also make the value apear of any fi=unction in the String.
    console.log(`Either you run the code or code runs you ${by} Hello ${fullName()} where ${x*y}`);

    // Can we combine two Template Strings.
